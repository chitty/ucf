*  Arup's Game of Dice  *
*************************
Amazingly, this game is even more "fair" than Craps, but the house still has a 
50,2% chance of winning, which is why the casino hasn't gone broke yet! 
Here are the rules:

1) Roll a pair of dice
2) If you roll a sum of 11 or 12, you win
3) If you roll a sum of 2, you lose
4) Otherwise, record what you've rolled, Let this sum be k; also known as your 
point
5) Roll one more time, If this roll exceeds your point(k), you win!
6) If this roll is the same as your point(k) or lower, you lose.
