One of the most "fair" games to play at a casino is Craps
Here is one version of how to play:

1) Roll a pair of fair six-sided dice
2) If you roll a 7 or 11, you win!
3) If you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose
4) Otherwise, record what you've rolled, Let this sum be k; also known as your 
point
5) If you rolled a point, continue rolling the pair of dice until you get either your point (k) or a sum of seven on the two dice
6) If k comes up first, you win!
7) If 7 comes up first, you lose.
